# Hello-World
introductory into getting into github
Sup. Wanted to get into the whole programming/coding scene after i did 5 years in prison (for robbing a Target
store in a Target employee outfit) and realized that, shit, i could have a lot of fun while breaking the law.
JK. JK. I knew there was a better way to do things and i just wanted a change. My G.F. at the time(still together
at time of writing) did paper and was reasonably good at it. What took me 2 weeks of grinding and robbing and stealing
to do she generally did in a few hours. It made me sick lmfao. And she did it with no knowledge of how really anything worked.
So i figured id figure out the ins and outs of the computer side of things then we would get to the mythical
"comfortable" stage of finance in our relationship sooner...ish... not so, as it turned out.
The more i got into it, the further away from the whole thinh she became. And the more i realized what could be done with it the more
i wanted to do it. More than anything.
So, now, the end goal is to change who i am and steal some crypto currencies along the way. and by change who i am
i mean; completely erase myself and my SSN from the face of the planet and become someone else. Some one without felonies and a record.
Some one who could still own a gun and pass his I.D. to a police officer and not have to worry about going to back to fu&*$%#
jail because of some bogus ass warrant for not checking in to my P.O. or any number of dumb ass things that place parolees back into 
jail for upward to 6 months a year.
I wanted something better. Better for me and my girl and our cat. I wanted something great, cause i felt i was 
great. And i saw all that and more iside of the computer.Hacking? Forget hacking. im trying to cast spells!!!
